"""Preview endpoint routing helpers.

Preview providers are served by a partner host gated by an ``agora-feature``
header. Agent sessions use these helpers to create private generated clients
for preview traffic while the caller's ``Agora`` / ``AsyncAgora`` client stays
on its production endpoint.

Everything under ``agentkit/preview/`` is temporary. When these providers ship
on the production gateway, delete this package and move the vendor classes into
``vendors/stt.py``.
